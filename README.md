Project1: This Python project analyzes extreme events in the temporal and frequency domains, focusing on seismic data. This project uses a publicly available seismic dataset and applies time-series analysis and spectral analysis techniques.

Project2: This project involved developing a predictive model to analyze the relationship between seismic amplitude (dependent variable) and two key independent variables: seismic frequency and depth. Using a simulated dataset, a multiple linear regression model was constructed to quantify how changes in seismic frequency and depth influence seismic amplitude. The analysis provided insights into subsurface geophysical dynamics, demonstrating how seismic attributes interact in complex geological settings. The project included data visualization, model evaluation using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE), and interpretation of the regression coefficients to understand the contribution of each variable.

Key Tools & Technologies: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Outcome:
The model achieved high accuracy, providing a statistically robust framework for predicting seismic amplitude based on subsurface parameters. This project highlights the practical application of machine learning techniques in geophysical data analysis.
